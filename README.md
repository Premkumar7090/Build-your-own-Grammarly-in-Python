# Build-your-own-Grammarly-in-Python
Spelling and Grammar Correction tool in Python...Usage of good grammar and correctly spelled words helps you to write and communicate clearly and get what you want. Whether you are working on an article, essay, or email, presenting your ideas with clear and correct language makes a good impression on your readers. Often while typing emails, essays, articles, etc one makes a lot of grammatical and spelling mistakes.

Grammarly is an American-based technology company that provides an AI and NLP-based digital writing assessment tool. It comes up with a lot of free and paid tools including grammar checkers, spell checkers, writing assistance, etc. In this project, we will use an open-sourced package gingerit to implement a model that can correct spellings and grammatical mistakes in the text.

GingerIt is an open-sourced Python package that is a wrapper around gingersoftware.com API. Ginger is AI-powered writing assistance that can correct spelling and grammatical mistakes in your text based on the context of the complete sentence.

Used this package you can:

Eliminate Grammatical Mistakes
Fix spelling mistakes
Correct punctuation errors
Enhance your writing
This package is not exactly a clone of Grammarly but can be considered as a basic version of it, as it provides some common features. For now, gingerit works only with the English language.
